                    Lorem Ipsum work deals with people, interaction, time, physical and psychological space and memory - facts and
                    phenomena that he records in a more-or-less abstract fashion. Generally Schlanger deploys cyclic electronic waves
                    as his visual source which he uses to generate amorphous forms that may appeal to the receptive viewer's more
                    primordial consciousness. You watch compositions of rhythmically moving, coloured forms that are in a state of
                    onstant flux. The image and the electronic sound are continually activating each other. Schlanger's oeuvre
                    represents a kind of parallel world where the abstract remains abstract and the riddle is never solved. However,
                    'Hymn to Ré' differs in a formal sense from the other tapes in this compilation. This extremely short work
                    presents us with images of hieroglyphs while a voice recites from 'Hymn to Ré'. This hymn is included in Sir Allan
                    Gardiner's 'Egyptian Grammar' and is originally located on the doorpost of the tomb of the Egyptian General
                    Haremhab. The same applies to all these works: This is not computer graphics! (see: 'Black Dog Dreams')
